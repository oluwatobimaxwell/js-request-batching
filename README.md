## (b) What are the challenges you faced? and how did you solve them?
- There is limited information on the internet (google/stackoverflow) regarding this topic - *http request batching*. So I had to study up on the basics of axios requests interceptors, paid close attention to features such as **request.interceptor** and  **response.interceptor**, as well as understanding the problem requirements in detail for me arrive at a reasonable solution.


## (b) Give another good use case for batching requests and its benefits
Use case:

 - Imagine an email client. It might need the userâ€™s name, their photo, possibly their email messages and maybe even information from their calendar and you can make things a lot more efficient by putting all those requests into a single HTTP request using batching.
-   We can also use batching for collecting dashboard widgets data.

Benefits:

 - Requests are sent at once, their by its time saving.
 - Reduced latency: Batched transactions can start immediately instead of waiting for other transactions to be completed.
 - Increased throughput: The storage system can perform parallel transactions and increase aggregate transaction throughput.
